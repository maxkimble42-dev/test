# PyTorch Guide

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. In this expo you will learn how to build a basic fully connected neural network. This is an excellent introduction to a difficult topic to understand. PyTorch was created to offer production optimizations similar to TensorFlow while making models easier to write.

### PyTorch compared to TensorFlow

- Better memory and optimization
- More sensible error messages
- Finer-grained control of model structure
- More transparent model behavior
- Better compatibility with NumPy

That means you can write highly customized neural network components directly in Python without having to use a lot of low-level functions.
